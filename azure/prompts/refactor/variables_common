Extract common Terraform module variables out from each resource.

Below are common "friendly" names for Terraform input variables to replace, only create variables for attributes that fit these descriptions.
* Tags
* Docker Image / Tag
* AWS Region
* AWS Instance Types
* AWS AMI ID
* Azure Location
* Azure Resource Group Name
* Azure VM Size
* Azure Storage Account Name
* GCP Region
* GCP Project ID
* GCP Machine Type

Do not extract variables for any attribute that can likely be referenced from another resource in this module.

Do not try to overly interpolate strings.

Do not omit any other resources.

Do not omit any attributes that were set. Do not add any new ones. Only replace with variable references.

Use common variable naming conventions.

I need you to return the code in its entirety, not just the changes as it can be tedious to make each change on my end.

A few syntax notes / reminders:

## Variables cannot be referenced from variables

The following is a syntax error. The 'tags' variable cannot reference the 'environment' variable. In cases like this just hard code both defaults.

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  default = "SOME_DEFAULT"
}

variable "tags" {
  default = {
    project = "SOME_DEFAULT"
    environment = var.environment
  }
}
```
