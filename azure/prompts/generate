Write the terraform `import` block code to import the list of resources into the appropriate terraform resources. 

I'll be using the experimental "-generate-config-out" flag on `terraform plan` so you do not need to add resource blocks.

Here is an example of what I'm looking for each resource.

```hcl
import {
  id = "SOME ID HERE"
  to = azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.main
}
```

Name each resource 'main' by default.

If there are multiple of the same resource type, just call them "main-0", "main-1" etc.

Finally, print the commands to import them into state as well as comments at the bottom of your output. Just a note, I'm using opentofu instead of terraform, they are identical in CLI usage, please output the binary name as `tofu` instead of `terraform`.

I don't need a lecture, just print the code and the commands.
